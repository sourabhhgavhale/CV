    <h3>Deadlocks</h3>
  </li>
    <h4>Necessary Conditions for Deadlock :</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>
      Mutual exclusion
    </li>
      One resource is held in nonshareble mode. If one process is holding resouce
      and another resource request it then requesting process should be delayed until
      it is released.
    <li>
      Hold and wait :
    </li>
      process is holding atleast one resource and waiting to aquire additional
      resource held by another process.
    <li>
      No preemtion :
    </li>
      Resource cant be preempted. Resource can be released only after the process
      holding it releases the resource after complition.
    <li>
      Circular wait :
    </li>
      A set of process exists P ={p1,p2,p2,...pn} such that p1 is waiting for resource held by p2,
      p2 is watining for resource held by p3 and so no.. pn is waiting on resouce held by p0.
    </ol>
    <h4>Resouce Allocation Graph :</h4>
    If there is no cycle in the resource allocation graph of the processes then there is no deadlock. But if
    cycle is present in the graph then deadlock may be the present.

    <h4>Deadlocks prevention :</h4>
    By ensuring atleast one of the conditions responsible for deadlock doesnt hold we can prevent deadlock occurence.
    <ol type="1">
    <li>
    <em>Mutual exclusion</em>
    </li>
    The mutual-exclusion condition must hold for nonsharable resources.
    <li>
    Hold and wait :
    </li>
    To ensure that the hold-and-wait condition never occurs in the system, we must
    guarantee that, whenever a process requests a resource, it does not hold any
    other resources.
    <li>
    No preemtion :
    </li>
    If a process is holding some resources and requests another resource that cannot be immediately
    allocated to it (that is, the process must wait), then all resources the process is
    currently holding are preempted. In other words, these resources are implicitly
    released. The preempted resources are added to the list of resources for which
    the process is waiting. The process will be restarted only when it can regain its
    old resources, as well as the new ones that it is requesting
    <li>
    Circular wait :
    </li>
    One way to ensure that this condition never holds is to impose a total ordering of
    all resource types and to require that each process requests resources in an
    increasing order of enumeration.
